Pictorial representation of test data using Matplotlib

Dataset details
Source of the Dataset: Kaggle
Attributes: Serial No, Motor type, rpm_read, tp_read
Number of Records:35,50
Sample records:2

Name of the libraries:
 Sci-kit,Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib libraries 

Purpose:
   We opted to use sci kit library because
1. Robust in nature
2. Built in machine learning tools
3. Supported by python

Functions you are using and purpose:
.read_csv()-to read and covert data from Excel into a dataframe .
.iloc() - to select preferred rows and columns 
.predict() - to predict the training and testing set result
.xlabel() - to label values in x axis
.ylabel() - to label values in y axis
